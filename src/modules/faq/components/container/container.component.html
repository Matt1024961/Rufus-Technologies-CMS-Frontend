          Is Wikipedia censored?
        </mat-panel-title>
      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
      Further information: Help:Censorship
      Wikipedia uses the minimum of censorship. Generally, only gratuitous explicit (pornographic) images are removed.
      The
      community of Wikipedia editors determine what text and images are displayed, so there may be material that offends
      some people. There may be those who are offended, shocked or disgusted by medical images, nudity, religious
      imagery
      and controversial images.
